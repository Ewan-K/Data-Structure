# Data Structure

This is a project containing the pure C implementation of common data structures I met(some advanced data sturctures may be implemented in C++ using STL), so that I can review them from time to time.
PS:
1. Comments may contain Chinese while output informaiton don't.
2. Tree Maker contains C++ tree visualization tools for AVL„ÄÅBST and B Tree.
