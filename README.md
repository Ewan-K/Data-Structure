# Data Structure

This is a project containing the pure C implementation of common data structures I met(some advanced data sturctures and I\O may be implemented in C++ using STL), so that I can review them from time to time.
PS:
1. Comments may contain Chinese while output informaiton don't.
2. Tree Maker contains C++ tree visualization tools for AVL„ÄÅBST and B Tree. But more visualization of data structures is available on visualgo.net.
3. I find it very difficult to review each line of code when preparing for post-graduate entrance examination. Maybe it's better to review them when I actually have to use these DS again.
